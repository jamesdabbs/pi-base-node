# pi-base-node

A node client to consume the PiBase API. The intention here is two-fold

* Provide black-box testing of the API under mocha
* Build a client suitable for use in the browser (under browserify)

This is a work-in-progress. Please contact [me](mailto:jamesdabbs@gmail.com) if you have questions.
